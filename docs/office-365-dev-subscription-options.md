# What you can build with your Office 365 developer subscription 

## From content plan
Developers need to choose their journey. Are they interested in Teams? Office Add-ins? SharePoint? We give them a value-prop for each. Once they know what to do, we provide links off to more info on getting set up. 

Note: each header below is an entry point from the developer program profile page

Turn on your subscription: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/get-started/get-started-tenant (describes turning on Teams in the subscription)
