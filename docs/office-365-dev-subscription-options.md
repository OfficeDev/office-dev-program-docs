# What you can build with your Office 365 developer subscription 

## From content plan
Developers need to choose their journey. Are they interested in Teams? Office Add-ins? SharePoint? We give them a value-prop for each. Once they know what to do, we provide links off to more info on getting set up. 

Note: each header below is an entry point from the developer program profile page 

## Microsoft Teams 

- Value-prop 
- [Turn on your subscription](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/get-started/get-started-tenant) (describes turning on Teams in the subscription) 
- Set up your development environment: Issue unclear which page to link to. There’s a page for Teams App Studio, Node.js, and C#. All 3? 
- Resources: List any videos, training, etc.. That would be interesting to a new developer to learn more... 

## Microsoft Graph 

- Value-prop 
- [Set up your subscription](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/docs/concepts/get-started)  
- Set up your development environment: Issue Doesn’t appear to be very specific steps. Just a list of prereqs for each platform. Like Python, and Android. 
- Resources: List any videos, training, etc.. That would be interesting to a new developer to learn more... 

## Office Add-ins  

- Value-prop 
- Set up your subscription: Issue There is no configuration page. Do we need one? (also this can just run on client-side. Be careful not to imply that it only runs in cloud) 
- [Set up your development environment](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/office/dev/add-ins/develop/create-and-debug-office-add-ins-in-visual-studio): Issue Doesn’t appear to be a setup page? Is this needed?
