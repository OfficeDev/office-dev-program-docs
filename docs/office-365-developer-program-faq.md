### What account can I use to sign up for the developer program?

You can sign up for the developer program by using one of the following account types:

- **Microsoft account** (created by you for personal use) - Provides access to all consumer-oriented Microsoft products and cloud services, such as Outlook (Hotmail), Messenger, OneDrive, MSN, Xbox Live, or Office 365. Signing up for an Outlook.com mailbox automatically creates a Microsoft account. After a Microsoft account is created, it can be used to access consumer-related Microsoft cloud services or Azure. 
- **Work or school account** (issued by an admin for business/academic use) - Provides access to all small, medium, and enterprise business-level Microsoft cloud services, such as Azure, Microsoft Intune, or Office 365. When you sign up to one of these services as an organization, a cloud-based directory is automatically provisioned in Azure Active Directory to represent your organization. For more information, see [Manage your Azure AD directory](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/active-directory-administer).
