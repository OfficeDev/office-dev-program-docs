# Office 365 Developer Program FAQ

The following are frequently asked questions about the Office 365 Developer Program.

### What is the Office 365 Developer Program and who should join it?

The Office 365 Developer Program is designed to help you build people-centric, cross-platform productivity experiences that extend Office 365. Join our program to get access to the tools, documentation, training, experts, and community events that you need to build great solutions for Office 365 products and technologies, including:

- [Excel](https://developer.microsoft.com/excel), [Outlook](https://developer.microsoft.com/outlook), [Word](https://developer.microsoft.com/word), and [PowerPoint](https://developer.microsoft.com/powerpoint) web add-ins
- [SharePoint](https://developer.microsoft.com/sharepoint)
- [Microsoft Teams](https://developer.microsoft.com/microsoft-teams)
- [Microsoft Graph](https://developer.microsoft.com/graph)

As a program member, you can get a free Office 365 developer subscription with 25 user licenses to use to build your solutions. This subscription will remain active for as long as you’re actively developing and deploying solutions.

For more information, see [Join the Office 365 Developer Program](office-365-developer-program.md) and [Build Office 365 solutions](build-office-365-solutions.md).
 
### I heard that developers can receive an Office 365 developer subscription if they join the program. How does that work?  

If you join the Office 365 Developer Program, you qualify to get a free Office 365 developer subscription. This is a special subscription designed to be used for application development only, and comes with 25 user licenses. 

After joining the Office 365 Developer Program, you'll have the option to receive and configure an Office 365 developer subscription. Your subscription is good for 90 days and can then be renewed for another 90 days based on valid developer activity. 

For more information, see [Set up an Office 365 developer subscription](office-365-developer-program-get-started.md).

### How many user licenses can I add with my subscription?

You can add up to 25 user licenses, including the administrator, for development purposes only. Using this subscription for any purpose other than application development is a violation of the license agreement. For more details about the licensing restrictions, see the [Office 365 developer subscription terms of use](terms-and-conditions.md).

### Why don’t you offer a one-year subscription anymore?

In April 2019, we transitioned to a new model where your subscription can be renewed perpetually every 90 days if you do valid developer activity. We believe that this model ensures that developers who are active in developing solutions can be given a subscription if they need one. In theory, if you are developing frequently, your subscription never expires; it is automatically extended. If you are developing on Office for a short time, and your subscription expires and is deleted, you can always get a new one. 

If you prefer to have a subscription that is available for a longer duration, we recommend that you get the Visual Studio Professional or Visual Studio Enterprise subscription. Included in the price of these programs is a free Office 365 developer subscription that is good for the life of your Visual Studio subscription. To access this, go to [Visual Studio | My Benefits](https://my.visualstudio.com/benefits). For more information, contact [Visual Studio customer service](https://www.visualstudio.com/subscriptions/support/). 

### What is valid developer activity?

We use a set of algorithms and telemetry that we get from your activity in the Office 365 Developer Program and on your Office 365 developer subscription to determine if you are actively developing. We check these regularly to update your status and determine if your subscription should be extended. 

### What activity do you track?

For more information about the kinds of activities that we track, see the [Office 365 developer subscription terms of use](terms-and-conditions.md).

### How long is my subscription good for, and when does it expire?

Your subscription is good for 90 days and is renewable based on valid developer activity. If you are using your subscription as a developer, it will be renewed every 3 months and will last indefinitely. You can find the expiration date, along with your subscription name, on your Office 365 Developer Program profile page. For more information, see [Renew an expiring subscription](subscription-expiration-and-renewal.md).

If you are joining the program through Visual Studio Enterprise or Visual Studio Professional, your subscription is automatically renewed until your Visual Studio subscription expires.

### When my subscription is about to expire, can I extend it?

The only way that you can extend your subscription is to do valid developer activity. If you are using this subscription for only word processing or spreadsheets, and you are not developing custom solutions, your subscription will expire and eventually be deleted. 

For more information, see [Renew an expiring subscription](subscription-expiration-and-renewal.md).

### If my subscription is going to expire, how much time do I have before it is deleted?

You have 30 days after your subscription expires to migrate any data. For the next 30 days, only the admin will have access to the subscription, and on the 60th day, the subscription and all its data will be deleted.

### What account can I use to sign up for the Office 365 Developer Program?

You can sign up for the developer program by using one of the following account types:

- **Microsoft account** (created by you for personal use) - Provides access to all consumer-oriented Microsoft products and cloud services, such as Outlook (Hotmail), Messenger, OneDrive, MSN, Xbox Live, or Office 365. Signing up for an Outlook.com mailbox automatically creates a Microsoft account. After a Microsoft account is created, it can be used to access consumer-related Microsoft cloud services or Azure. 
- **Work account** (issued by an admin for business use) - Provides access to all small, medium, and enterprise business-level Microsoft cloud services, such as Azure, Microsoft Intune, or Office 365. When you sign up to one of these services as an organization, a cloud-based directory is automatically provisioned in Azure Active Directory to represent your organization. For more information, see [Manage your Azure AD directory](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/active-directory-administer).
- **Visual Studio ID** (created for your Visual Studio Professional or Enterprise subscriptions) - We recommend that you use this option to join the developer program from within the Visual Studio Gallery to get the full benefits as a Visual Studio subscriber. 
 
### As a Microsoft Partner, can I receive a subscription? 

Yes, you can follow [these instructions](office-365-developer-program.md) to join the Office 365 Developer Program and set up an Office 365 developer subscription. However, if you already have a Visual Studio Enterprise or Visual Studio Professional (MSDN) subscription, you can get an Office 365 developer subscription as a benefit. To access this, go to [Visual Studio | My Benefits](https://my.visualstudio.com/benefits). For more information, contact [Visual Studio customer service](https://www.visualstudio.com/subscriptions/support/). 

### As a Microsoft full-time employee, can I receive a subscription?

Microsoft employees cannot sign up for this offer. However, all Microsoft full-time employees have access to a free Visual Studio (MSDN) subscription that includes access to Office E3 Developer. You can access this benefit at [Visual Studio | My Benefits](https://my.visualstudio.com/benefits).

### As a vendor working at Microsoft, do I qualify for a subscription?
