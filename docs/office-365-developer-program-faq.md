# Office 365 Developer Program FAQ

The following are frequently asked questions about the Office 365 Developer Program.

### What is the Office 365 Developer Program and who should join it?

The Office 365 Developer Program is designed to help developers create intelligent, connected solutions that enable customers and organizations to do more. If you want to create custom solutions and test them by using Office 365, the developer program provides tools, learning, and access to experts through community events, plus a test subscription of Office 365. 

All of this includes support for Office 365 development workloads, including:

- Add-ins for [Excel](https://developer.microsoft.com/excel), [Word](https://developer.microsoft.com/word), and [PowerPoint](https://developer.microsoft.com/powerpoint) 
- [SharePoint Framework, Add-ins, webhooks, and REST APIs](https://developer.microsoft.com/sharepoint)
- [Microsoft Graph](https://developer.microsoft.com/graph)
- [Microsoft Teams](https://developer.microsoft.com/microsoft-teams)

For more information, see [Join the Office 365 Developer Program](office-365-developer-program.md) and [Build Office 365 solutions](build-office-365-solutions.md).
 
### I heard that developers can receive an Office 365 developer subscription if they join the program. How does that work?  

If you join the Office 365 Developer Program, you qualify to get a free Office 365 developer subscription. This is a special subscription designed to be used for application development and testing only, and comes with 25 user licenses. 

After joining the Office 365 Developer Program, you'll have the option to receive and configure an Office 365 developer subscription. Your subscription is good for 90 days and can then be renewed for another 90 days based on valid developer activity. 

For more information, see [Set up an Office 365 developer subscription](office-365-developer-program-get-started.md).

### How many licenses can I add with my subscription?

You can add up to 25 users, including the administrator, for development and testing purposes only. Using this subscription for any purpose other than development and testing is a violation of the license agreement. For more details about the licensing restrictions, see the [terms of use](terms-and-conditions.md).

### Why donâ€™t you offer a one-year subscription anymore?

In April 2019, we transitioned to a new model where your subscription can be renewed perpetually every 90 days if you do valid developer activity. We believe that this model ensures that developers who are active in developing solutions can be given a subscription if they need one. In theory, if you are developing frequently, your subscription never expires; it is automatically extended. If you are developing on Office for a short time, and your subscription expires and is deleted, you can always get a new one. 

If you prefer to have a subscription that is available for a longer duration, we recommend that you get the Visual Studio Professional or Visual Studio Enterprise subscription. Included in the price of these programs is a free Office 365 developer subscription that is good for the life of your Visual Studio subscription. To access this, go to [Visual Studio | My Benefits](https://my.visualstudio.com/benefits). For more information, contact [Visual Studio customer service](https://www.visualstudio.com/subscriptions/support/). 

### What is valid developer activity?

We use a set of algorithms and telemetry that we get from your activity in the Office 365 Developer Program and on your Office 365 developer subscription to determine if you are actively developing. We check these regularly to update your status and determine if your subscription should be extended. 

### What activity do you track?

To see the kinds of activity that we track, see the [terms of use](terms-and-conditions.md).

### Does the subscription also include a subscription to Azure?

This offer does not include a subscription to Azure. However, to receive free access to Azure services, you can [create a free Azure account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/). 

### How long is my subscription good for, and when does it expire?

Your subscription is good for 90 days and is renewable based on valid developer activity. If you are using your subscription as a developer, it will be renewed every 3 months and will last indefinitely. You can find the expiration date, along with your subscription name, on your Office 365 Developer Program profile page.

If you are joining the program through Visual Studio Enterprise or Visual Studio Professional, your subscription is automatically renewed until your Visual Studio subscription expires.

### When my subscription is about to expire, can I extend it?

The only way that you can extend your subscription is to do valid developer activity. If you are using this subscription for only word processing or spreadsheets, and you are not creating and testing custom solutions, your subscription will expire and eventually be deleted. 

When your subscription is about to expire, you will receive an email reminder as well as yellow and red warning notifications in your Office 365 Dashboard that contain instructions for how to extend your subscription.

These warnings look like this: 

- If your subscription expires in 30 days, you will see a yellow warning:

- If your subscription has expired, you will see a red warning:

### If my subscription is going to expire, how much time do I have before it is deleted?

You have 30 days after your subscription expires to migrate any data. For the next 30 days, only the admin will have access to the subscription, and on the 60th day, the subscription and all its data will be deleted.

### What account can I use to sign up for the Office 365 Developer Program?

You can sign up for the developer program by using one of the following account types:

- **Microsoft account** (created by you for personal use) - Provides access to all consumer-oriented Microsoft products and cloud services, such as Outlook (Hotmail), Messenger, OneDrive, MSN, Xbox Live, or Office 365. Signing up for an Outlook.com mailbox automatically creates a Microsoft account. After a Microsoft account is created, it can be used to access consumer-related Microsoft cloud services or Azure. 
- **Work or school account** (issued by an admin for business/academic use) - Provides access to all small, medium, and enterprise business-level Microsoft cloud services, such as Azure, Microsoft Intune, or Office 365. When you sign up to one of these services as an organization, a cloud-based directory is automatically provisioned in Azure Active Directory to represent your organization. For more information, see [Manage your Azure AD directory](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/active-directory-administer).
- **Visual Studio ID** (created for your Visual Studio Professional or Enterprise subscriptions) - We recommend that you use this option to join the developer program from within the Visual Studio Gallery to get the full benefits as a Visual Studio subscriber.  

### Is the program available in my language?

The Office 365 developer subscription is only offered in English. 

### As a Microsoft Partner, can I receive a subscription? 

Yes, you can follow [these instructions](office-365-developer-program.md) to join the Office 365 Developer Program and set up an Office 365 developer subscription. However, if you already have a Visual Studio Enterprise or Visual Studio Professional (MSDN) subscription, you can get an Office 365 developer subscription as a benefit. To access this, go to [Visual Studio | My Benefits](https://my.visualstudio.com/benefits). For more information, contact [Visual Studio customer service](https://www.visualstudio.com/subscriptions/support/). 

### As a Microsoft full-time employee, can I receive a subscription?

Microsoft employees cannot sign up for this offer. However, all Microsoft full-time employees have access to a free Visual Studio (MSDN) subscription that includes access to Office E3 Developer. You can access this benefit at [Visual Studio | My Benefits](https://my.visualstudio.com/benefits).

### As a vendor working at Microsoft, do I qualify for a subscription?

Yes, you can follow [these instructions](office-365-developer-program.md) to join the Office 365 Developer Program and set up an Office 365 developer subscription. But even for vendors, this subscription is designed to be used _for application development and testing only_. If you are not doing valid development activity, your subscription will not be renewed.
