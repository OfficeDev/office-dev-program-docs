# Office 365 Developer Program subscription expiration and renewal

This page contains information about renewing an expiring Office 365 developer subscription.

### What is the difference between my developer subscription expiring versus being renewed?

There are two types of subscriptions, both of which expire 12 months from creation:

- **Non-renewable**, which were distributed from March until Fall 2018. 
- **Renewable**, which were distributed beginning in Fall 2018.

### How do I know which kind of subscription I have?

#### Non-renewable subscriptions

If you see the following yellow or red warning in your dashboard, you have a non-renewable subscription, and it must be replaced before your old subscription expires. It will clearly state that your subscription cannot be renewed. You will also get emails to your Office Developer Program member ID to remind you about these warnings.

To create a replacement subscription, choose **Set Up Subscription**. 

Next, migrate any important data that you need to save to your new subscription. See tips on data migration later in this topic.

#### Renewable subscriptions

If you see the following yellow or red warning, this means that you have a renewable subscription, and you just need to do valid developer activity and your subscription will be renewed for another 90 days.

### Why is my current subscription not renewable?

Renewability is a new capability that was not available when we launched the Office 365 Developer Program in March 2018. We introduced this in Fall 2018.
