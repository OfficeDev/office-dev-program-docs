# Welcome to the Office 365 Developer Program

Join your friends and colleagues in the Office 365 Developer Program. Use the Office 365 developer subscription to develop your solutions independent of your production environment. You can build solutions for Microsoft Teams, Office Add-ins, Microsoft Graph, SharePoint Framework, SharePoint Add-ins, and more.

## Join the Office 365 Developer Program

1. Go to the [Join the Office 365 Developer Program](https://developer.microsoft.com/office/dev-program) page. 

2. In the upper-right corner, choose **Sign in** to sign in with your Microsoft account or Azure Active Directory-enabled email.

    > [!NOTE]
    > Remember the account that you sign in with. You’ll sign in to the [Developer Program dashboard](https://developer.microsoft.com/office/profile) with this account. This account is different than the admin ID that you'll use for your Microsoft 35 developer subscription.
