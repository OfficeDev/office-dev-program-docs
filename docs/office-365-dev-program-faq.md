# Office 365 developer program FAQ


### How long is my trial good for, and when does it expire?

Your trial subscription is good for nine months. You can find the expiration date, along with your subscription name, on your Office 365 Developer profile.

### When my trial is about to expire, how can I extend it?

We are unable to extend existing trial subscriptions. However, following are three alternatives to consider: 

- If you have a Visual Studio Enterprise (MSDN) subscription, you can get an indefinite Office Developer subscription.  For steps to get the benefits, see [Visual Studio Subscriptions - The Office 365 Developer Subscription Benefit](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4019175/visual-studio-subscriptions-the-office-365-developer-subscription-bene). For additional help, contact [Visual Studio customer service](https://www.visualstudio.com/subscriptions/support/). 

- You can pay for the existing subscription (currently $99.00), which can be done through the Billing section of your subscription. You can [contact Office support](https://support.office.com) to help you.  

    *SMEs: We need way more information about this option, perhaps its own separate page. Customers need to understand how it works and how they can use it to extend an existing subscription.*

- Sign up for a new nine-month trial subscription with a unique tenant ID. However, note that nothing from your current trial can be converted over.   

### How many licenses can I add with my nine-month trial?

*SMEs: We need an answer for this*

### As a Microsoft Partner, can I receive a trial subscription? 

As a Partner, you may already have a Visual Studio Enterprise (MSDN) subscription and can get an indefinite Office 365 Developer subscription as a benefit. For more information, contact [Visual Studio customer service](https://www.visualstudio.com/subscriptions/support/). 

### As a Microsoft full-time employee, can I receive a trial subscription?

Microsoft employees may not sign up for the trial subscription. However, you may already have a Visual Studio Enterprise (MSDN) subscription and can get an indefinite Office 365 Developer subscription as a benefit. For more information, contact [Visual Studio customer service](https://www.visualstudio.com/subscriptions/support/).    

### As a vendor working at Microsoft, do I qualify for a trial subscription?

Yes. Follow the steps at [Set up an Office 365 developer subscription](office-365-dev-program-get-started.md).

### What applications does the trial include? 

*SMEs: We need an answer for this*

### Does the trial also include a subscription to Azure?

*SMEs: We need an answer for this*
