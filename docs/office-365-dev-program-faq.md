### Current extension information

We are unable to extend existing subscriptions with the promo codes we have. Following are a few alternatives for you to consider: 

- If you have a Visual Studio Enterprise (MSDN) subscription, you can get an indefinite Office Developer subscription.  For steps to get the benefits, see https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4019175/visual-studio-subscriptions-the-office-365-developer-subscription-bene. You can contact Visual Studio customer service at https://www.visualstudio.com/subscriptions/support/. 

- Pay for the existing subscription, which can be done through the Billing section of the tenant. You can contact Office support at https://support.office.com to help you.  

- Request and activate a new promo code to set up a net new tenant with a unique tenant ID for another 12 months. Nothing from your current trial can be converted over.   

If you’d like to go with option #3, you can sign up for a one-year trial at https://dev.office.com/devprogram.   

### Current partner information

As a Partner, you may already have a Visual Studio Enterprise (MSDN) subscription and can get an indefinite Office Developer subscription. For more information, contact Visual Studio customer service at https://www.visualstudio.com/subscriptions/support/. 

Alternatively, we may be able to provide a promo code if you send a brief description of your development scenario.
