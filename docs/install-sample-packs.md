# Use sample data packs with your Microsoft 365 Developer Program subscription

Your Microsoft 365 Developer Program sandbox subscription comes with sample data to save you time by providing data and content you need to build and test your solutions.

## Sample data installed on the instant sandbox

If you have an instant sandbox, the sample data packs are already pre-installed. Your instant sandbox includes the following sample data:

- **Microsoft Graph user, mail, and calendar data** - 16 sample users with user data and content to help you model your solutions. This includes user mailboxes, calendar events, and integration into a Teams developer environment with simulated chats and team memberships.
- **Teams sample data** pack with the following customized developer environment:
  - **App sideloading** pre-configured
  - **Five sample teams, channels, tabs, and chat sessions** built around the 16 sample users.
  - **App Studio / Teams Developer Portal pre-installed and pinned** to help you streamline the creation of your Teams app manifest and app package, plus the card editor and a React control library.

- **SharePoint Framework sample data** – Choose from six site templates that you can install and evaluate as custom solutions for your organization (with one pre-installed).

## Install sample data packs in your configurable sandbox

If you have a configurable sandbox, you can quickly install the sample data so that you can focus on your solutions rather than spend time creating sample data yourself.

> [!NOTE] 
> You can't install sample data packs on any other Microsoft 365 subscription. These sample data packs are only compatible with the Microsoft 365 developer sandbox subscription you get as part of the Microsoft 365 Developer Program.

You can find sample data packs on your [Microsoft 365 Developer Program dashboard](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/profile), at the bottom of your subscription tile.

The following sample data packs are currently available:

- Users - Installs 16 fictitious users with licenses, mailboxes, and metadata, including names and photos for each user. Use Microsoft Graph APIs to work with user sample data in the following ways:
  - Get specific user details
  - Update user
  - Get direct reports
  - Prepare organization chart  
  - Get users by department

- Mail & events - Adds Outlook email conversations and calendar events for each of the 16 sample users. Use Microsoft Graph APIs to work with mail and events sample data in the following ways:

  - Get emails filtered by date
  - Get upcoming events
  - Update/delete upcoming events

  > [!NOTE]
  > You must install the Users sample data pack before you install Mail and Events.
    
- SharePoint Framework sample data – Choose from six site templates that you can install and evaluate as custom solutions for your organization (with one pre-installed).


### Install the Users sample data pack

Before you install the Users sample data pack, make sure that you have a Microsoft 365 developer subscription and that you assign a license to yourself as the admin.

> [!NOTE]

To install the Users sample data pack:

1. Select the **Users** box at the bottom of your subscription tile.
2. Copy your administrator ID; you will need it to sign in to your subscription.
3. Enter your administrator ID and password on the sign in page.
4. Consent to the permissions as an administrator of your Microsoft 365 developer subscription.
5. Configure your passwords for all sample users. You will need to have one shared password defined for easy administration of all your fictitious users.
6. The data will be installed. The installation should take about 5 minutes.
7. When installation is finished, you'll be notified by email, and the box on your subscription tile will be green. You can now install the Mail and Events sample data pack.
