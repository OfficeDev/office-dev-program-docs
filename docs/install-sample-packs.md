## Use sample data packs with your Office 365 developer subscription

You can install sample data packs on your Office 365 developer subscription
Sample data packs save you time by automatically installing data and content you need to build and test your solutions. This includes fictitious users, metadata, and photos to simulate a small corporate environment. You can quickly install the sample data so that you can focus on your solutions rather than spend time creating sample data yourself.

You can find sample data packs on your [Office 365 Developer Program dashboard](https://developer.microsoft.com/office/profile), at the bottom of your Office 365 subscription tile.

The following sample data packs are currently available:

- Users - Installs 16 fictitious users with licenses, mailboxes, and metadata, including names and photos for each user. Use Microsoft Graph APIs to work with user sample data in the following ways:
  - Get specific user details
  - Update user
  - Get direct reports
  - Prepare organization chart  
  - Get users by department

- Mail and events - Adds Outlook email conversations and calendar events for each of the 16 sample users. Use Microsoft Graph APIs to work with mail and events sample data in the following ways:
  - Get emails by users
  - Get emails filtered by date
  - Get upcoming events
  - Update/delete upcoming events

### What do the sample data packs add to my Office 365 subscription?

The Users sample data pack, which you install first, creates 16 fictitious users on your subscription, and includes the licenses for each user, and mailboxes, names, metadata, and photos for each.

The Mail and Events sample data pack adds Outlook email conversations and calendar events for each of the 16 users installed.

### How do I install the Users sample data pack?

### Are more sample data packs coming?

Yes. We will add sample data packs for SharePoint and OneDrive. In the future, we will consider adding sample data packs for more products and technologies, including Office Add-ins, Microsoft Teams, and more.
