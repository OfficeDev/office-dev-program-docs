# Use your developer subscription to build Office 365 solutions

What do you want to build with your Office 365 developer subscription? Depending on what you are interested in, you can do a lot of different things. Following are some of the products and technology areas that you can start with.

## Microsoft Teams

Microsoft Teams is a chat-based workspace in Office 365 that integrates with the apps and services that people use to get work done together. The Microsoft Teams developer platform makes it easy for you to integrate your own service, whether you develop custom apps for your enterprise or SaaS applications for teams around the world.

Here's how to get set up and coding with Microsoft Teams:

1. [Prepare your Office 365 developer subscription](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/platform/get-started/get-started-tenant).
2. Set up your development environment. This process will vary depending on the type of app or service you are building. For details, see one of the following:

  - [Get started on the Microsoft Teams platform with Node.js](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/platform/get-started/get-started-nodejs-app-studio)
  - [Get started on the Microsoft Teams platform with C#/.NET]https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/get-started/get-started-dotnet-app-studio)

## Microsoft Graph

You can use Microsoft Graph to interact with the data of millions of users in the Microsoft cloud. Use Microsoft Graph to build apps for organizations and consumers that connect to a wealth of resources, relationships, and intelligence, all through a single endpoint: `https://graph.microsoft.com`.

To get set up and coding with Microsoft Graph, see [Getting started building Microsoft Graph apps](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/get-started) or the Microsoft Graph [Quick Start](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/quick-start).

## Office Add-ins

You can use the Office Add-ins platform to build solutions that extend Office applications and interact with content in Office documents. With Office Add-ins, you can use familiar web technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to extend and interact with Word, Excel, PowerPoint, OneNote, Project, and Outlook. Your solution can run in Office across multiple platforms, including Office for Windows, Office Online, Office for the Mac, and Office for the iPad.

To set up your development environment and create your first add-in, see the [Office Add-ins quick starts](https://docs.microsoft.com/office/dev/add-ins/).

## SharePoint Framework

The SharePoint Framework (SPFx) is a page and web part model that provides full support for client-side SharePoint development, easy integration with SharePoint data, and support for open source tooling. With the SharePoint Framework, you can use modern web technologies and tools in your preferred development environment to build productive experiences and apps that are responsive and mobile-ready.

To get set up and start coding with the SharePoint FrameWork:

- [Set up your Office 365 developer subscription](https://docs.microsoft.com/sharepoint/dev/spfx/set-up-your-developer-tenant)
- [Set up your development environment](https://docs.microsoft.com/sharepoint/dev/spfx/set-up-your-development-environment)

## SharePoint Add-ins 

A SharePoint Add-in is a self-contained piece of functionality that extends the capabilities of SharePoint websites to solve a well-defined business problem. You can create two types of SharePoint Add-ins: SharePoint-hosted and provider-hosted. For more information, see [SharePoint Add-ins](https://docs.microsoft.com/sharepoint/dev/sp-add-ins/sharepoint-add-ins).

To get set up and start coding SharePoint Add-ins:

- [Set up your subscription](https://docs.microsoft.com/sharepoint/dev/spfx/set-up-your-developer-tenant).  
- Set up your development environment: 
  - [Get started creating SharePoint-hosted SharePoint Add-ins](https://docs.microsoft.com/sharepoint/dev/sp-add-ins/get-started-creating-sharepoint-hosted-sharepoint-add-ins)  
  - [Get started creating provider-hosted SharePoint Add-ins](https://docs.microsoft.com/sharepoint/dev/sp-add-ins/get-started-creating-provider-hosted-sharepoint-add-ins)
