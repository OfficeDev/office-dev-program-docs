# Join the Microsoft 365 Developer Program with a Visual Studio Professional or Enterprise subscription

Visual Studio Professional and Enterprise subscribers can join the Microsoft 365 Developer Program through Visual Studio. When you join from Visual Studio, you can set up a Microsoft 365 E5 developer subscription that renews automatically, regardless of activity signals, for as long as you remain a subscriber. It will not be subject to expiration due to inactivity (or our failure to detect activity that is not be in scope for our renewal monitoring).

> [!NOTE]
> Your Microsoft 365 E5 developer subscription is for development purposes only and can be revoked if you use it for purposes other than development. For details, see the [Microsoft 365 Developer Program Terms and Conditions](terms-and-conditions.md).

## How do I get a renewable Microsoft 365 developer subscription?

If you don't have a Visual Studio Professional or Enterprise subscription and you want one, see the [Visual Studio subscription](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/pricing/) page.

If you already have a Visual Studio Professional or Enterprise subscription, you can join the Microsoft 365 Developer Program and get a Microsoft 365 developer subscription from your Visual Studio subscriber portal. Go to [Visual Studio | My Benefits](https://my.visualstudio.com/benefits) and click the **Microsoft 365 Developer subscription (E5)** tile, and you will automatically join the Microsoft 365 developer program with your Visual Studio ID.

## What is the difference between joining the program directly and joining with my Visual Studio subscription?

When you join the Microsoft 365 Developer Program with your Visual Studio subscription, your Microsoft 365 E5 developer sandbox subscription will automatically renew for the lifetime of your Visual Studio subscription. 

If you join the developer program directly, your Microsoft 365 E5 developer sandbox subscription is good for 90 days and will renew indefinitely based on your development activity.
